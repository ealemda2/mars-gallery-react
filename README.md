## Curiosity Rover Image Gallery - React
This is a very basic React project that demonstrates how to fetch a list of images using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and display them on an image slider using [react-image-lightbox](https://github.com/ealemda2/react-image-lightbox).

To run:
```
npm install
```

```
yarn start
```

The site should run on http://localhost:3000 provided nothing else is using the same port. If :3000 is busy, you should be prompted to use the next available port (i.e :3001, :3002...)

You can add/change styles, fetch different images, add captions, experiment or add it to your website.
