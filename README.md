This is a very basic React project that demonstrates how to fetch a list of images using ``` [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) ``` and display them on an image slider using 

Fetches Mars rover images from [NASA's Curiosity api](https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=2000&page=1&api_key=e6qeMVwVAobScq3QGBBCsWdk4haOxrTmcBfB3RPI)
Displays them in a dynamic image slider in a shuffled order.

To run:
```
npm install
```

```
yarn start
```
The website should run on http://localhost:3000 provided nothing else is using the same port. If :3000 is busy, you should be prompted to use the next available port (i.e :3001, :3002...)
